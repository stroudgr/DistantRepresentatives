# Distant Representatives

In the distant representatives problem, given input shapes in the plane, the goal is to place one point in each shape so that the points are as far apart from each other as possible. 


At the University of Waterloo, I helped discover an approximation algorithm when the shapes are rectangles, see the paper [here](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2021/14598/). 

In my spare time, I've implemented a visualization tool for the problem using the FabricJs drawing library and a Flask backend server on Azure.
